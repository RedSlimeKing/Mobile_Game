Purpose 
	Our team will be making a game much similar to a tamagotchi game where the user will be incharge of taking care of a pet.

Description 
	Our game will present a almost life like pet that the user will take care of. The pet will require the user to feed them X meals a day with timed delay between. Using the gps the user can choose to bring their pet for a walk. Hopefully we will be able to incorporate AR viewing of the said pet. Achievements in games will be something like how much they take care of the pet such as remember to feed them 7 day in a row.
