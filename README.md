**The Game**   
Our game, inspired by *Tamagotchi* will present the player with a virtual pet that they will have to take care of. Like a real pet, the player will have to feed them at regular intervals, as well as other maintenance routines such as washing them, walking them, and petting them.

The game will feature the ability to feed, wash and pet your pet using touch-screen interaction and optionally Apple Watch interaction, as well as walking with your pet in the real world using your GPS and pedometer. The game will also feature push notifications to remind you to take care of your pet, and Siri integration to allow you to ask Siri how your pet is doing at *any* time. Lastly, the game will feature achievements to reward players when they have successfully cared for their pets for extended periods of time.

We believe this game will not only be entertaining, but can be used as a sort of "pet-caring trainer", or simply as a low-cost alternative to a real pet.
